Broadclub cuttlefish display 13 body patterns. Young cuttlefish can display almost the full array of patterns that adult cuttlefish can. Their skin is covered with papillae, which can be altered in size and shape with changing body patterns. One of their most distinguishing features is their cuttlebones, which is more of an internal shell than a bone. It is broad and flat and gives cuttlefish heads their characteristic shape.",

The second is the discrete tracking, where the trumpetfish stays close to some big fishes (groupers, carangids) or even hawksbill sea turtles until it has the opportunity to approach unsuspecting prey. The body coloration can be uniform or mottled in a range of grey, brown, or dark green. Some fish are uniformly bright yellow. The rear part of the body is normally black with white dots.",

This small species typically reaches 40 cm (16 in) in length. Greatly enlarged pectoral fins and an extremely short tail, coupled with diminutive dorsal and caudal fins all concentrated towards the rear, give the coffin ray a distinctive pear-like shape. It is a varying shade of brown in color above, and has tiny eyes and a large, highly distensible mouth. When approached, the coffin ray tends to keep still in its place of concealment on the sea floor. As a result, many divers, swimmers, and bathers have been shocked after accidentally contacting it.",
